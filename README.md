# Spark Performance Tuning

This repository is the ultimate guide for mastering advanced Spark Performance Tuning and Optimization concepts and for anyone preparing for Data Engineering Interviews involving Spark. Additionally, this repository serves as a reference for all the code snippets used in my [Spark Performance Tuning Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWAuYt0wgRcLCtWzUxNg4BjnYlCZNEVth) on YouTube. The goal of the playlist and the accompanying code snippets is to make complex concepts in Apache Spark easy to understand, while also developing a deep understanding of how things work under the hood.
